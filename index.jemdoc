=== Brief Bio
Hi! I'm Divy, (among other things) a machine learning engineer and scientist. My primary interests are in machine learning and natural language processing, including but not limited to: LLMs, search science and generative artificial intelligence. I rarely if ever use my full name, other than in official documents or manuscripts/publications.

Previously, I've worked as aa machine learning engineer at [https://casetext.com/ Casetext], where I applied methods from natural language processing (principally transformers/LLMs) to tackle problems in legal search and information retrieval -- including using language models for ranking. Prior to that I was a data scientist at [https://kount.com/ Kount] (now part of Equifax) where I worked on algorithmic and machine learning methods to mitigate online transaction fraud. My interests currently span understanding and leveraging both small and large language models to tackle a variety of tasks such as question answering, language generation and search relevance.
 
In a past life, I received my BS and PhD degrees in physics respectively from UCSB and Stanford. I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to various domains, such as tabular data, images and natural language. At present, I reside in Seattle, Washington and am originally from Boise, Idaho. When not doing ML, I like enjoy any sort of physical activity including but not limitied to cycling, lifting and bouldering.
