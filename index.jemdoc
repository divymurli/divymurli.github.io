=== Brief Bio
Hi! I'm a machine learning engineer at [https://casetext.com/ Casetext], where I apply methods from natural language processing (principally transformers/LLMs) to tackle problems in the legal tech space, specifically using language models for search ranking. Previously I was a data scientist at [https://kount.com/ Kount] (now part of Equifax) where I worked on algorithmic and machine learning methods to mitigate online transaction fraud. My interests currently span understanding and leveraging both small and large language models to tackle a variety of tasks such as question answering, language generation and search relevance.
 
In a past life, I received my BS and PhD degrees in physics respectively from UCSB and Stanford. I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to various domains, such as tabular data, images and natural language.
