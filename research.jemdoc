== Machine Learning

I've been keeping a log of personal projects on my [https://github.com/divymurli github page], and am interested in applying techniques from machine learning and data science to various problems. 

== Physics
See Publications in the sidebar for my papers in theoretical physics. A large part of my past research efforts focussed on supergravity models of cosmology, which manifests as coupling 4d $\mathcal{N}=1$ to a nilpotent multiplet, also known as the so-called /de Sitter/ supergravity. I've also worked a bit on scattering amplitudes, both in extended supergravities and $\mathcal{N}=1$ theories where supersymmetry is spontaneously broken.
