<h3>Professional sketch</h3>
<p>Hi! I’m Divy, a machine learning engineer and scientist. My interests lie primarily in generative artifical intelligence, information retrieval and search science. Currently, I focus on building production grade search systems by hooking large language models to data sources at <a href="https://pryon.com/">Pryon</a>. Some representative work I do is in developing efficient and accurate retrieval solutions using a combination of sparse and neural retrieval methods. Feel free to peruse this site; some pages are more up-to-date than others. </p>
<p>Previously, I’ve been employed fulltime by <a href="https://casetext.com/">Casetext</a> (acquired by Thomson Reuters) and <a href="https://kount.com/">Kount</a> (acquired by Equifax). I briefly worked as a consultant at <a href="https://www.uberduck.ai/">Uberduck</a> on ML for audio generation although I’m a novice in TTS topics. My LinkedIn page is up to date with my employment history. </p>
<p>In a past life, I trained to be a theoretical physicist for nine years at UCSB (BS 2014) followed by Stanford (PhD 2019). I used to think about using supersymmetric Einstein gravity to model early universe cosmology and inflation. My PhD dissertation is available <a href="https://searchworks.stanford.edu/view/13322788">here</a>, advised by Renata Kallosh. </p>
<h3>Personal </h3>
<p>I reside in Seattle, Washington, spent my formative childhood years in Boise, Idaho (with a brief stint in Bangalore, India during high school) and did my higher education in California. If someone asks where I’m ‘from’, Boise is my first and closest answer. </p>
<p>I’m an avid cyclist and weightlifter, a less avid climber and a novice salsa dancer. I like German cars, a perfect medium rare steak, Austria/Switzerland and cities that feature hilly topography surrounded by mountains. If I didn’t live in Seattle I’d choose Zürich or Innsbruck. </p>
<p>I almost never use my full name other than in official documents and manuscripts or patents.</p>
<p>I’m keen to connect with the Seattle AI community. If you’re based in Seattle, interested in machine learning and/or want to go on a bike ride, reach out!</p>
