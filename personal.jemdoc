= Personal Projects

In addition to the collaborative work on large scale image collaboration, I have been building up my personal [https://github.com/divymurli github repository]. Here's a summary of personal projects:
- a two-latent layer [https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02282 ladder variational autoencoder], implemented in PyTorch. This is an extension of a homework assignment for Stefano Ermon's [https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/ Deep Generative Models] course, and I hope to improve and generalize it. The original sourcecode is written using Theano, Lasagne and Parmesan and is available [https://github.com/casperkaae/LVAE/blob/master/run_models.py here]. See also [http://orbit.dtu.dk/files/121765928/1602.02282.pdf this paper] on training ladder variational autoencoders. 
- an recurrent neural network to predict stock prices using data from [https://www.quandl.com Quandl], implemented in TensorFlow.
- A TensorFlow implementation of Siamese neural networks, following [https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/ this tutorial]
