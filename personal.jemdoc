= Personal Projects

Over the past few months, I have been building up my [https://github.com/divymurli github repository]. While it is in its early stages, I have been adding small personal repositories to it, in addition to the collaborative work I have been doing in large scale image classification. This past summer (2018), I wrote an RNN to predict stock prices using financial data from [https://www.quandl.com/ Quandl], and also followed [https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/ this tutorial] on implementing siamese neural networks, except I wrote the model in TensorFlow instead of Keras. I am currently working on a PyTorch implementation of [https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.02282 this paper] on ladder variational encoders; the original source code written using Theano, Lasagne and Parmesan is available [https://github.com/casperkaae/LVAE/blob/master/run_models.py here]. This implementation is not quite ready yet; I hope to have it up soon. The code will be based on Homework 2 of Stefano Ermon's newly offered course on [https://deepgenerativemodels.github.io/ Deep Generative Models] here at Stanford.
